I’ve been given nothing other than basic outlines of them. Plus the second half of this book feels like it was written in a day.

(127, 22, 22, 'Ahmad', '4.00', 'This legal thriller from John Grisham follows Lacy Stoltz, a character from a previous book called The Whistler, as she works on a new case. Lacy works for the Florida Board of Judicial Conduct (BJC), and investigates corrupt judges. This book takes places three years after the events of The Whistler, and Lacy is getting bored with her job. Things get a little more interesting when she meets Jeri, a woman who is convinced that there is a judge in Lacy\'s jurisdiction that has murdered several people. Now all they need is some proof... The book has 46 main chapters, and a total of about 356 pages of story in the digital version. I haven\'t read The Whistler yet, but this book works as a stand alone story and you don\'t need to have read The Whistler to enjoy this book. There are some references to things that happened in that previous story, but they are all explained well and aren\'t vital to the plot of this book. This thriller is a bit different than most, as it starts out right away in the first chapter with Jeri already believing that she knows who the killer is, but the problem is getting enough proof to bring him to justice. Since the man that she has been watching is a judge, he knows the legal system well and knows what to do to avoid detection. What follows is an intriguing game of cat and mouse, with some tense moments and unsettling details. The story changes perspectives a few times, so you get to see the point of view of different characters, including a killer. The chapters are just numbered, not named after the character that you are following, so you have to pay attention. I prefer this style, as it is more of a surprise when you jump to a different character. Grisham really develops the characters in this story, as you learn about the protagonist\'s work life, as well as their interpersonal relationships. This makes sense, as it seems like the plan was to use the characters in multiple books. Overall, I enjoyed the book. The beginning of the story is really an attention-grabber, and even though there were slower paced parts that dealt with character relationships, there was always enough mystery and action to keep me reading. The ending wasn\'t the most surprising, and even though I had a good idea where it was going, I actually wasn\'t very disappointed in the execution. I might have preferred a slightly different conclusion, but I still appreciated how the loose ends were wrapped up. It is almost more about the journey than the destination with this one. The way Grisham writes the motivations of a killer, and makes it seem believable, is always unsettling.', 'Positive', NULL),

It is very slow to develop, and follows predictable plot lines every step of the way. There is virtually no action in this book, very little suspense, no twists, no thrills. About 80% of the way through, the story starts to heat up and becomes briefly entertaining, but that action peaks almost immediately and then the story falls into a continued long and drawn out anti-climax. It ends and I wondered why I spent hours reading this book. I read quite a few and liked Grisham’s earlier novels. I could not get excited about this one at all.', 'negative', NULL),

His writing of what Bannick can do with his \"Maggots\" software is poorly done. The most striking error is the \"double clove hitch\", one of the primary threads of the story.

In fact, the story gets you out of the confines of a courtroom and keeps you on the run.  I also enjoyed the intimacy created around each character, the scene flow, and the changes of POV . . . this will make a great screen adaptation. I was especially tickled that I have either lived in or traveled to the places mentioned.  Whether you are a new or longtime fan of legal thrillers . . .

I was HOOKED from the start, and I devoured it at an alarming rate, even for one of Quinn’s rom coms. And this IS a rom com, albeit a very tense and steamy one. I loved the playfulness and humor of the story, the interactions with our hero’s brothers, the vibrancy of the connection, the push/pull, and sizzle of chemistry. This workaholic alpha doesn’t know what hit him – our heroine is bold and proves herself to be strong and stubborn too. Their connection is absolute FIRE, and I loved the friction between them. It’s a hot slow burn from strangers to enemies to lovers, and I was all too happy to hold on for the ride. The story follows Huxley, a guy who is married to his job. There’s never been anything more important in his life than work, especially since he’s in business with his brothers. So when a deal seems to be slipping through his fingers, Huxley lets loose a few lies in an act of desperation. He claims to be engaged with a baby on the way, when that couldn’t be further from the truth. Unsure how to handle the predicament he’s gotten himself into, Huxley’s guard is down when he meets an unusual woman. Lottie meets Huxley while wandering through a rich neighborhood (looking for a rich husband, as one does), and she’s also feeling desperate. The two discover that they might be able to help each other out, and that’s the foundation of their not so meet cute. But as the two spend time together, their clashes begin to escalate – and there seems to be a fine line between love and hate. I always, ALWAYS look forward to new books by Quinn, and I went into this one blind. It’s the start of what I sincerely hope is a brand new series, and I loved the vibe. It’s got tons of humor and great family connections, as well as the sexual tension that Quinn has been ramping up with some of her newest releases. This book is seriously fan-worthy at times, with a torturous slow burn that borders on scorching. Huxley and Lottie have zero problems with their chemistry – it’s their communication that could use a little help. I loved watching this workaholic discover that he’s got a jealous, possessive side, and it rears its ugly head many times. Their path to love has bumps along the way, but I SO appreciated that the vibe remained (mostly) light throughout. It’s certainly not as angst-ridden as some of Quinn’s other romances, which means that cute cover is not inaccurate… this just isn’t your momma’s rom com, lol.

Win-win, right? Yeah, it\'s all complicated. This was a hoot of a read, one that left me with a smile on my face by the end.

The dual pov really helps though to understand he\'s not a big of a d-bag as he wants her to believe. What I loved about this is when Hux messes up, he almost immediately realised this and goes to work straight away on rectifying it. It wasn\'t drawn out, he fully commits it was his fault and he needed to fix it and did so. Loved this couple! Only thing I could have done without is the constant questions about past partners in the first part of the book.

It is, at best, average Michael Connelly, well back in the middle of the pack in all his legacy of excellent crime novels. The worst part of reading it is constantly flinching at Connelly\'s stretching and bending of the narrative to fit what he apparently feels are the political requirements of contemporary society. The book is absolutely drowning in Covid piety. Ballard can\'t take a step without reassuring us that she\'s putting on her face mask. Heck, even when she has to lower her mask to drink a cup of coffee she quickly announces to us that she has turned her head away from everyone else. It\'s not a pretty sight to watch a fine novelist desperately pandering to popular culture the way Connelly does in this book, and I suspect the novel will age very poorly because of it. Maybe the book\'s just too California for me, but by a quarter of the way in it was already feeling like the Karen of crime novels. I\'m sick to death of being lectured in real life.

I’ve read all the Harry Bosch books, including the shorts, the ones with Haller, and now all the Ballard and Bosch series. This book is very tightly written, drips with suspense throughout, and rings authentic with modern Los Angeles, complete within the setting of the pandemic, and references to masks, the vaccine, and the difficult circumstances between the police and the public, including references to protests and efforts to defund policing, and how all of this impacts the detective’s work environment. As each chapter ends, I’m immediately drawn into continuing on to the next. I’m not going to give away any spoilers. We are rapidly drawn into a complex web of multiple murders and serial rapes. The story is complex with multiple characters and victims, all expertly and coherently woven together. This book is more about Ballard than Bosch, she takes the lead and is really the main character here, Bosch appears in Chapter 8. It took me some time to warm to her as a character in this series, but she is presented masterfully and has really developed as the series has progressed. Her life situation is more realistic now, and she is more likable as a character. Bosch, while he has appropriately aged during the series, is presented in good form, not as the aging and almost decrepit man he was in some of the previous novels. His mind is sharp, he is his usual gritty, rough around the edges self, and he is seamlessly blended into the story as the main supporting cast member. I downloaded the paired audiobook and listened at the same time as I read the book. This is a great way to read this, and I like that Titus Welliver has again been selected as Bosch’s narrator, whereas Christine Latin does a great job as Ballard.

Ballard is determined and fearless, willing to fight the LAPD bureaucracy as well as take on violent criminals.

Not satisfied with one case though, there are women being raped and filmed by a two man team. Like her mentor, Harry Bosch, Renee always sees the job through. The relationship between Ballard and Bosch is nicely rounded. Ballard makes connections on both cases but Harry has years of experience to draw on and is only too happy to be kept in the game. I could never tire of Bosch and Ballard is a force of nature. As you would expect from Connelly, the plotting is masterful.

Moriarty has been very successful writing good domestic thrillers but this reader got the impression that Moriarty needs new challenges for her prodigious talents. I hope she finds them but Apples Never Fall isn’t it. Just what is wrong? Shallow characters, no character development and muddy motives mar every section of the book. The plot is nonsensical and the lack of comprehensible plot growing out of character actions makes the entire book fall flat. Because of these flaws the book is neither a domestic thriller or a literary examination of family dysfunction. The book ends up being nothing much at all. I’m tired of the taste for O’Henry endings, but the supposed twist just isn’t believable and is telegraphed from the beginning. Because Moriarty is so skilled the reader doesn’t notice unless thinking critically. It is the literary equivalent of drinking soda or eating a candy bar, but not as a special treat. Instead this book is the kind of thing you’re sorry you ate as you struggle with disappointment and nausea. This reads like a waste of time, money, calories and treats.

Definitely read it, especially if you’re a fan of her other work but even if you aren’t. Secondly, I remember thinking about halfway through that even though it was a good read, it lacked her usual musings on people and relationships and families etc. Boy was I wrong. it all comes rushing in towards the end and then you realize what you’d missed all along, much like the characters themselves. Thirdly: I really had a hard time with the conclusions in this book. The main thing I want to say is, it is not OK to excuse toxic by calling it “complicated“. There are bad and toxic relationships and bad and toxic behaviors. it is not OK to write them off as part of life and relationships and just complicated; sometimes you really do need to walk away. The book very much highlighted how generational some damage is and how scars are left behind even if you determine to be different. All of the Characters need to be in therapy, not just the one of them. Lastly: you can love someone and realize that you can’t and shouldn’t trust them, and recognize that it’s unwise and damaging to keep them in your life, especially if little innocent kids are involved.

(188, 83, 22, 'Ahmad', '4.00', 'Greenlights is a remarkable first book from an already renowned artist. Kind of a mashup of Anthony Bourdain with Ernest Hemingway, McConaughey tells stories with the aplomb of accomplished raconteur. Part memoir, part life guide and part ethic Greenlights is worth reading for many beyond McConaughey’s fan base; basically anyone who likes a good man’s man adventure story. Born into the lower middle class in East Texas, McConaughey looks back nostalgically at a childhood few would envy. His parents divorced and remarried each other twice, he was subject to corporal punishment and money was always an issue. Yet he doesn’t complain about disadvantage. In fact he honors his parents despite their shortcomings. He adheres to a philosophy of choosing to recalibrate what seems like the inevitable until it turns into a green light or way forward in life. After a rite of passage involving brawling with a barroom bouncer, McConaughey pursued acting with the drive and hard work ethic that was instilled into him. Finding early success, he choose to live in a way directly opposite to the Hollywood scene. Traveling the country with his dog, going off on expeditions to the middle of Africa and South America, McConaughey sees livin (drop the g to indicate it’s always a verb) as more than just the material success and creature comforts many of us settle on. Finally, after years of womanizing, McConaughey settled into a successful monogamous relationship and fulfilled his life long ambition of being a father. Nearly simultaneously he chose to walk away from lucrative rom-coms to focus on something more artistic. Initially successful in winning an Oscar for the Dallas Buyers Club, McConaughey admits that he hasn’t achieved the popular success he envisioned. But that is all grist for the mill, experiments in livin that are ongoing. If this is the kind of man you would like to read about, Greenlights will be an enjoyable and inspirational read. It’s rare that a successful actor has such a distinctive off air personality. But if you’re turned off by physical conflict, wild adventures and a man who brags about rarely showering alone than Greenlights is not for you. Personally, while not finding all parts of McConaughey’s biography admirable, I found enough of him to be so different than what Hollywood typically churns out that the book was worth reading.

This is followed by the father getting into a fight with his son, he should man up and steal. This book is what is wrong with so many people in society. You must tell the truth, but if you lie, do not get caught. Matthew writes with so many adjectives that he must have literally had a thesaurus open and used every single synonym for a word.

This book suffers from being a Frankenstein\'s monster of tropes and themes. Both main characters suffer from a lack of development, arc and likeability. Ness is an odd mix of aggressive and spineless. She is unnecessarily rude with little provocation and then completely spineless when she is actually being treated poorly. I\'m not convinced that the female mc is all alone in the world because of her teen pregnancy. It\'s probably because she\'s purposefully acts dumb and has a bad attitude.I usually enjoy this authors wit, but the use of sarcasm and metaphor is becoming overwrought and lazy. Instead of telling us that the hero looks like Ryan Gosling in Drive use your writing skills to describe him. That\'s just lazy. Also, is he supposed to be a likeable doctor? He seems like a shut shaming, snobby narcissist . I wish that the author took more time to flesh out her ideas lately. Because when she\'s on there are very few people who are as capable of humanizing unlikable characters. I think she needs new beta readers.

Not only did I laugh my socks off, but I also shed a tear or two. That said, and before I go any further, I’d like to mention the title. For me, the male protagonist was too good to be true, and because the few faults I found in him were nothing to shout about, it didn’t seem fitting. And despite not being keen on animated covers, I liked the refreshing change from Shen’s usual ones.  Whilst I fell hard for Dr Cruz Costello and adored Tennessee, I can’t say the same thing about their families, supposed friends and townsfolk. However, these characters strengthen the novel’s plot, making Bad Cruz an engaging, if not, frustrating read. What I enjoyed most was how Shen wove Cruz and Tennessee’s intertwining backstories together; the importance she gave to emotional struggles and gosh—their chemistry is something else!  It pained me to see that Tennessee was on the receiving end of her family’s constant criticism and couldn’t muster up the courage to fight back. I found it difficult to comprehend as she’s Mama Bear in persona, has tried hard not to rely on them and is hard-working to boot. Hiding behind her attire and look only seemed to add fuel to the fire in town. So, when she did defend herself, I wanted to give her a high-five. Cruz is the epitome of the good guy. Well-respected, gorgeous and successful, he’s always eager to please whoever. Aah, but guess who\'s a thorn in his side? My goodness, there were moments in the story when I didn’t know where to put myself. It was a case of what Tennessee was capable of doing next. Who sold me was Bear. Wise beyond his years, the close connection he has with his mother melted my heart. I did feel that this lovely couple deserved an even bigger send-off than they got, and both families\' show of making amends with Tennessee fell a tad flat. This gal deserves the world and more. Will Cruz be her knight in shining armour? Read Shen’s enemies-to-lovers-cum-romcom to find out!

This book is AMAZING, honestly I loved every word and mostly every character. LJ Shen\'s writing is as per usual perfection. Her characters are mesmerising and addictive to read. This book is funny, sweet and romantic with a small dose of angst thrown in for good measure. So we get to meet Cruz, town doctor, gorgeous and popular, from a good family and well respected. A good honest man and I fell totally in love with him from the first words that popped out of his gorgeous sexy mouth. Cruz has known Tennessee all their lives but they have always been at loggerheads with each other; lets face it he has the attention of every woman in town as the most eligible single batchelor and is never short of admirers. Tennessee is the towns disappointment. Pregnant at sixteen to her high school boyfriend Rob, who ran and left her as soon as he found out he was to become a dad. Now she is raising her son all alone with the help of her awful judgemental family and works in the local diner to make ends meet to provide a life for herself and her son Bear who is now thirteen. The whole town has an opinion about Tennessee and none of it good, she is labelled the town slut. She dresses and acts the way people perceive her until she really believes this is the part she has to play. Tennessee lets people put her down constantly and yet never defends herself, ultimately believing this is what she deserves in life for her mistakes. Really this lady is the bomb. Funny, strong (but underneath vulnerable ) she has no filter when she speaks her mind which leads to some awkward but hilarious situations that made this book what is is, amazing in all ways. I loved Tennessee but felt so sorry for her at the same time too. With her sister getting married to Cruz\'s brother very soon, all the families decide to take a cruise together, only Tennessee having had one too many to drinks this particular night and feeling very sorry for herself she ends up booking her and Cruz onto the wrong ship and this is where the fun really starts. I loved the way no matter what happened Cruz had Tennessee\'s back, he sees the woman and the potential she could really be and sets out to show her just that, but things start to get complicated and before they know it a little thing called chemistry is playing with their feelings, each fighting to ignore what they really feel for each other.  A wonderful feel good book that made my heart ache with joy. A book that makes you smile, believe in humanity and one I won\'t forget in a hurry. PS.

The snark was real and although not truly LOL, still pretty funny and confrontational. Loved how the heroine went through a real hero journey. Because her unjustified hang ups were really sad and she didn\'t deserve to be treated how she was (and she chose to play the role they have her). Extra juicy points for 3d characters all around. Even the minor ones. Even the mean ones. It truly warms my heart when authors do this - because I know it\'s much easier to write 100%mran characters or secondary ones that just serve the plot. So to just add a little something here and there to make them more human... Ahhhh joy! I would have liked a bit more work for forgiveness but at least there was a reckoning so I\'m good. LJ is an auto buy for me but no author automatically gets a 5 star from me. Having said that, I still think 4 stars is pretty good.

I adored her lack of filter and her humour and her strength to raise a lovely son alone (I would love a 2nd gen story about Bear- he was a gorgeous character too). She has carried the burden of judgement and played the role of the clumsy, ditzy woman about town for so long its almost as if she believes the part she has been assigned. She doesn\'t strive for more or defend herself. Through the events of the book she becomes stronger and lives her truth without hiding her kind heart. This is a story of healing and love and strength. Cruz is the town\'s golden child while Tennessee is the awkward outcast. I love how Cruz really sees her and how they become better together.

I enjoy a good procedural and since I\'ve been immersing myself in Assassin\'s Creed: Valhalla over the last few months, the idea of a killer using Viking runes and symbolism was appealing. Evan Wilding makes for an interesting lead character, a brilliant British academic who has to overcome the additional obstacle of having dwarfism. This was a first for a main character for me, and it\'s a fresh twist on the usual \'expert\' protagonist role. I\'ll admit I found him somewhat pompous and occasionally irritating, but overall he\'s a good main character to anchor the story. This is both well written and well researched. There\'s a lot of material here on Norse deities, customs, and history which ties in directly to the killer\'s beliefs but it\'s written in such a way as to be entertaining rather then a history lesson. The only real issue I had with the story is the insistence of the author doing the whole \'the main characters are secretly attracted to each other but can\'t say it\' trope. It adds zero to this story. They\'re already good friends, just keep it simple and leave it at that! One final note. Since this appears to be the first in a series, I\'d like to personally thank the author for doing the right thing and giving readers a proper and satisfying ending. If you\'re thinking of getting this book, have the peace of mind that there\'s no cheap cliffhanger awaiting you that so many other writers employ. This is the way to get readers to buy more in the series, and based on this, I\'ll be one of them.', 'Positive', NULL),

The book has two main protagonists: Detective Addie Bisset, and her friend the forensic semiotician Dr. Evan Wilding. A semiotician is someone that studies signs, and in this case the quirky Evan also has knowledge of different languages, runes, history and more. Evan has dwarfism and stands at four foot five, and we are introduced to him as he is with his pet goshawk named Ginny, who has been authorized to hunt pigeons in the park in Chicago. When Addie is called to a very strange ritualistic murder scene with cryptic runes, she immediately summons Evan to help with the case. It becomes clear that there are riddles to be solved to determine the identity of the disturbed killer, and Evan\'s unique expertise makes him the perfect person to get to the bottom of it. There is quite a bit of focus on the two main characters; with Addie being an almost formulaic strong female police detective, while Evan is a snarky brilliant academic type; and there are even some hints at a slight romantic tension between these two friends. The pair must work together to solve the mystery, before more lives are lost. Overall, while I did find some of the historical information and mythology to be interesting, it was also hard for me to suspend disbelief and become invested in the mystery elements of the story. The characters and interactions seemed so unlikely and forced; and even the reveal at the end seemed somehow both predictable and unrealistic at the same time. It felt like the author was trying too hard to create quirky and endearing protagonists, instead of crafting a clever and gripping murder mystery. This isn\'t exactly my cup of tea, and I was a bit disappointed with the plot; but maybe you\'ll connect with these characters more than I did.', 'Positive', NULL),

And the book seems to have been edited rather laxly, if at all. Example: butchered foreign words. Toward the beginning of the book, one of the leads, supposedly an off-the-charts genius who \"speaks\" (not likely; try \"reads\") twelve dead languages, tries sprinkling some Latin into a conversation. But every bit of that Latin is botched: In a single paragraph, we get wrong noun case, wrong verb person, wrong word choice, clunky idiom.

When a second murder contains similarities, Detective Addie Bisset and her partner Detective Patrick McBrady realize they are up against a serial killer. The slayer has left pieces of a long poem at each site, each with clues that could solve the killer’s motive and identity. The fact that the messages consist of ancient runes adds a difficult challenge, one that Addie hopes will be successfully translated by semiotician Dr. Evan Wilding. Addie and Evan lead us through the action, and Ms. Nickless deftly describes both characters as they race to catch the unknown suspect before there is another killing. The deep knowledge of runes, epic poetry, and the ritualistic customs of people who lived long before us lends an aura of believability to the story. While Addie is pounding the pavement searching for and verifying clues, Dr. Wilding is performing his own style of police procedural research, each matching the other step by step. The crafted result by Ms. Nickless creates a perfect pacing that draws the reader into the story, keeps us interested during the middle section, and finishes at a run. If you’ve never read a Barbara Nickless novel before, you are in for a rare treat. Her members of the police force are hardened but not to the point where they have become jaded and lost sight of the human aspects of their job. Dr. Wilding is an interesting character, and Ms. Nickless provides a detailed sketch that emphasizes both his talents and his flaws, certainly enough to cause me to want to see him in a future book.

The characters are weakly drawn with a nod to the usual list of ‘tick box’ inclusions- maverick cop undermined by her supervisors- quirky civilian aide; in this case an intelligent professor with dwarfism- romance simmering under the surface- etc etc. The focus of a murder is an Anglo Saxon setup with clues of ancient language, runes, bog bodies and Vikings and boy, every other page contains some over the top waffle, including some full pages of squiggles and indecipherable poems. The police investigators are pathetic. No impact whatsoever. The plot is unbelievable, tilting towards ridiculous.

(299, 93, 23, 'AD Ali', '5.00', '\"“In the future . . . if by some miracle you ever find yourself in the position to fall in love again . . . fall in love with me.”  I\'m going to start this review off with this statement: I didn\'t cry while I was reading this book, but I did cry several days later when I was looking back on Lily\'s story. That shows how emotionally charged this story is, along with the true power behind Colleen\'s writing. I\'m not going to give away any spoilers because you need to go into the book blind. If you want to know what happens, there are definitely some reviews out there that tell you the big twists and turns. But take my advice and don\'t spoil this book for yourself. It will lose a lot if you go in knowing exactly what to expect. So seriously, don\'t do it to yourself. Just let the beauty of Colleen\'s writing sweep over you and sink in.  “All humans make mistakes. What determines a person\'s character aren\'t the mistakes we make. It\'s how we take those mistakes and turn them into lessons rather than excuses.”  This is honestly not only one of the best reads of 2016, but also one of the most (if not the most) empowering. I want to give this book to every man, woman, and even teenager (it\'s definitely a NA/adult read) and tell them... READ THIS NOW! Do you want to know why? Because this book carries with it a very strong message, one that shows strength and courage that many people might not have at the time, but after reading will understand and gain. I honestly don\'t know if there has ever been a time when I was prouder to be reading the heroine\'s story due to her choices. Ultimately though, Colleen Hoover wrote a book that everyone can take something away from. Colleen always writes such unique stories, and this one is certainly no exception. But the one thing I will say is that this is truly her best book yet.  “Just because someone hurts you doesn\'t mean you can simply stop loving them. It\'s not a person\'s actions that hurt the most. It\'s the love. If there was no love attached to the action, the pain would be a little easier to bear.”  Lily\'s story is one that I never wanted to stop reading. If I know that I\'m going to need to read a book in multiple sittings (which was the case with this book), I usually try to find a good place to stop. One in which, nothing major is happening and nobody is facing some drastic/perilous moment. Well you see the problem with this book is the fact that there is literally NO. GOOD. STOPPING. POINT! None! There was never a part where I felt safe in letting this book sit overnight because I knew that the story and the what if\'s would play endlessly in my mind. So I stayed up and read it all in one sitting because I simply couldn\'t stop. Lily was someone that I connected to right from the get go. I knew as soon as the book started that I would like her, and that never once stopped while I was reading. However, I didn\'t realize how much her character would affect me while I was reading. As I said before, after I was finished reading, I couldn\'t have been prouder of her decisions. The strength she had throughout the story to go through what she did, but also her resolve and conviction just made me constantly cheer her on. Lily is truly one of the most admirable characters that I have ever had the pleasure of reading about, and that admiration goes extraordinarily deep.  “Life is a funny thing. We only get so many years to live it, so we have to do everything we can to make sure those years are as full as they can be. We shouldn\'t waste time on things that might happen someday, or maybe even never.”  I mentioned it briefly above, but this book has a very powerful message, and this message is actually carefully woven into the story from page 1. You obviously don\'t realize it when you start reading the novel, but it\'s there when you look back after finishing. And this is also why I\'m going to reiterate the importance of going into the story blind, because just as unexpected and emotional it is for the reader to read and witness what Lily goes through, it is even more unexpected and emotional for Lily. This is where this book truly shines, because you as a reader feel like part of the story. There\'s a very slow burn while reading, one in which we get to know characters and see the develop in the ways that we as humans get to know each other...but then Colleen rips that metaphorical rug out from under all of us, and shocks us with one revelation after another. But you know what? That\'s exactly how life is sometimes...sometimes you never see things coming in a million years and you have to figure out how to deal with these radical changes you never thought would happen.  “It stops here. With me and you. It ends with us.”  Where this book really got me though was the meaning of the title. Throughout the entire time I was reading, I kept wondering what the title meant. Because come on...this is Colleen Hoover and literally EVERYTHING has some significance (no matter how small). And when I got to the part of the story where the title finally made sense, guys let me tell you...this had an impact on me like no other. I just sat there with my book in my hands staring at the page for a solid 5 minutes. It is the perfect title for the perfect book.  “Fifteen seconds. That’s all it takes to completely change everything about a person. Fifteen seconds that we\'ll never get back.”  I connected with this book in my own way, and for that I am extraordinarily thankful to Colleen Hoover for even writing this book. The author\'s note at the end was just as powerful and amazing as the rest of the story, but it shows just how personal this story was for her to write. I applaud Colleen for writing this book and not \"\"making things easy\"\" for the main character or glossing over the \"\"bad parts.\"\" This is an incredibly realistic book that makes you realize many things and leaves an imprint on your soul. It\'s important to remember that everyone must make extraordinarily difficult decisions in their life, and not everyone will agree with them. If this book even empowers one woman to take steps in making an important decision, the Colleen Hoover did her job. And I count myself lucky to have had the honor of reading this story because I am a changed person because of it!  Happy reading :)\"', 'Positive', NULL),
(300, 94, 23, 'AD Ali', '5.00', '\"*Spoiler-free review*  I have a confession to make here, folks:  I dismissed Colleen Hoover years ago and I haven\'t read anything from her since.  It\'s true. Three or four years ago I went through a string of so-so to bad Colleen Hoover books, and I decided to just put her out of my mind. I ignored her new releases, and I lumped her into my mental pile for authors who are \"\"not for me.\"\"  Recently, one of my friends wanted to buddy read this book. I thought, \"\"Gah, pay full price for a book I\'m not going to like?\"\" However, I sucked it up and sort of grumbled about it, but I decided to give it a go.  And this book blew me away.  The Colleen Hoover I last read wasn\'t writing books at this caliber. This was a whole different level.  For one, there are none, and I mean NONE, of the tired romance tropes presents in this book. In fact, this book was a little more woman\'s fiction than romance, if I\'m being honest. While I guess it can still be classified, genre-rules-style, as romance, it is more about Lily\'s life experiences and the lessons that she learns about herself than anything else. There is a romance present, but I don\'t think it is the main focus of the story. While I\'m not typically a women\'s fiction fan, I think that if this book took any other trajectory, it wouldn\'t have been as powerful.  I typically don\'t read reviews before starting a book. In fact, I didn\'t even read the blurb for this one, or if I did, I forgot it before starting to read. I liked that. I think going in blind with an open mind and minimal expectations is the way to go. Though the twists and turns aren\'t 100% unexpected, the author very much succeeded in pulling the rug out from under me on more than one occasion.  I\'m usually not a fan of books where people say, \"\"Wow, that made me think. This book is a thinker.\"\" I usually just roll my eyes internally because I assumed that the readers are being played like emotional pawns. I know, I\'m judgy. But in this case, yeah, I was thinking a whole hell of a lot. It made me reevaluate how I perceive others and their relationships, and it made me rethink my biases. People are always know-it-alls until they are in the situation themselves, and then it doesn\'t seem quite as simple.  The author made one right decision after another with this story. I think that is the key to its success. The author made a relatable, human character in Lily, and gave each supporting character their positives and negatives. There are no villains here. No easy answers. Colleen Hoover also made an insanely smart decision to have only Lily narrate the story. There was no other choice, really, but it gave readers a laser-focus on her, which is where our focus deserves to be.  While this book has a positive ending, it is also a story that can be described as gritty, difficult, hopeful, powerful, and crushing, all at the same time. It is a long story, but it has a fast-pace with plot elements thrown in at the right times to keep interest engaged. I couldn\'t put the book down from the moment I got into the groove, and I read this story all night until the last page. The dedication is also important to read, but make sure you do it after you\'ve finished the story and not before.  Colleen Hoover impressed me so much with this story. It made me rethink a lot of things, but most of all, it made me rethink how I judged Colleen Hoover years ago. I won\'t dismiss her so easily again.\"', 'Positive', NULL),

To make your reader fall in love with a character and also hate them is quite a feat. I also really liked the simple yet sharply observed descriptions of how the characters moved; I don\'t think I\'ve ever visualised that so vividly, and it really added to the action in each scene.

I\'d also like to caution that this review may contain slight spoilers, although I\'ll try my best not to mention anything specific, as I don\'t want to ruin the story for anyone, yet it\'s difficult to discuss how I\'m feeling without mentioning a few things.  This book put me through the ringer, and I\'m still feeling the aftershocks. I love books that make me question my own beliefs and really give me pause to stop and think. It Ends With Us is one of those books.  I have no personal experience of the subject matter but I have always had sympathy for anyone going through such a situation. It was no surprise that I really felt for Lily and shared her pain, grief, heartache, and confusion. I found myself constantly stopping to imagine how I might feel, how I would act, if I was in a similar situation, and I honestly don\'t know how I would deal with it.  What shocked me, what was entirely unexpected, was how much I felt for Ryle. Don\'t get me wrong, I wanted her to do what she did, and he was definitely in the wrong, but he wasn\'t a really nasty person. He was hugely flawed, damaged, and he couldn\'t control his emotions, but there was no doubt in my mind that he loved her. Probably too much which is where his issues stemmed from.  When I reflected on the initial scene where they met (so so good - the dialogue was unbelievably brilliant) I could see how self-aware he was. He indulged in one night stands with no strings and he didn\'t have relationships because he knew he was incapable of same. He should have stuck to that, but then we wouldn\'t have had a story.  I loved the letters to Ellen and the retelling of her time with Atlas. It was heartwarming and gut-wrenching at the same time. I really felt their connection, and I was rooting for them and then I became conflicted because Ryle was so perfect at the start and I felt their chemistry and their love and then...  Gosh, my heart is pounding again. And that twist - oh my Lord, I was cut up all over again when that happened.  I don\'t think I\'ll every forget this book. The last one that ripped my insides apart was Bright Side by Kim Holden (so good - go read it if you haven\'t already.) Different story but it delivered the same powerful emotional turmoil.  My only complaint is that I wanted more of \"\"present day\"\" Atlas but I\'m greedy like that! A little novella now would be great, Colleen, hint hint!  I loved the personal note Colleen included at the end, and the personal connection she had to this story shines through.  It is quite simply masterful. Absolutely superb. She nailed the emotions and managed to end it on a positive note and I\'m going to be feeling all the feels for a lot while.

(305, 99, 23, 'AD Ali', '5.00', '\"A new author for me and one who has left an impression.  Ryle is definitely not my favourite character but I surprisingly finished this book with no burning sense of hatred towards him. I was ready to really despise Ryle once the first incident/event happened, but as the book progressed those damn shades of grey became more apparent. The complexity of being in such a situation, and the internal conflict one can go through was depicted so well through Lily – I couldn’t help but feel for her, even as I cringed sensing strongly that the first incident/event wouldn’t be the last.  There is a bit of a love triangle in this but not in the traditional sense so to speak and not in a way that had me thinking hell no, there’s no cheating (physical or emotional). Rather Lily finds herself making difficult decisions that align her path once again with her first love - Atlas.  Still not sure how much I believe the “There is no such thing as bad people. We’re all just people who sometimes do bad things.” But in the context of this book and the characters the author did wonderfully at highlighting those varying shades of grey that manifest in messy ways in lived reality. One of the key reasons that I always say ‘I hope I would do….’, when talking to friends and family, because you just never know what you would do if you found yourself in such a situation.  The journal entries from Lily’s youth had me loving Atlas.  Throughout this book my emotions were engaged, and at 95% I could feel the tears emerging, stinging my eyes - Lily is one strong, brave woman.  A book that had me absorbed and one I’ll remember, and I so see myself re-reading this at some point.  However, whilst I was absorbed in this book, there are a few things that concern me a tad now I’ve had time to think a little after reading. For example, there seems to be no concern/consideration of the fact that no matter how much he doesn’t want to Ryle may hurt the next women he dates/marries – something his child, Lily’s child could witness, but there’s no sense of how he will stop himself from raising his hands/fists. Shouldn’t this be something Lily would also be concerned about?  Also, the attempted rape – I don’t know as I sit back and let what happened sink further into me, I just don’t feel like Ryle was truly confronted with the horror what he almost did – although when Lily reminds him of what he did and askes him if he would want his daughter to stay with such a man – that scene is pretty powerful.  Part of me does wish the author had made me feel a little less pity for Ryle, although whilst I was a tad sympathetic it wasn\'t a lot.

One of the reasons I love getting books like these is to get a chance to delve into the world building they do and get to learn about the vehicles, weapons and technology created for them. While this book shows you a lot of lovely pictures of all this cool tech you don\'t get a whole lot of information on them. Don\'t get me wrong. You will find some really interesting information here that you may not be able to find anywhere else, but it\'s sparse overall. For instance Captain America\'s shield (after you go through the stuff the movie already tells you) only gets maybe two sentences describing it. Two; for such an iconic item. The information you do get is lopsided. You may only get as much as a name for a gun on one page, a quick list of features on a suit in another, then some deep detail on the rare occasion.  In the end I do not regret getting this book, but I am disappointed that its potential was never realized. If you are a big fan of the movies, and don\'t mind some rehashing of information, then this is a great book to have. If you really wanted a sort of tech book or something with a lot of previously unknown background information you will get a little bit of that. I guess for me it\'s just enough to recommend it, but I\'m pouting about it. \"', 'Positive', NULL),

Most of this art mirrors the art that took New York by storm in the late 1970\'s and some artists are still riding that wave and now their work is receiving a rebirth.  The leader of the Grafitti Artists in the late 70\'s was Keith Haring , who took the world by storm. Though he is not still with us, the artists that survived the grafitti wave are now some of the most sought after artists today. I do believe many of these new artists are young ( not all) many are finally getting their due. But as Keith Haring had to combat the public first before any gallery would pick him up, the same story goes for these artists who almost doodle and daydream onto the canvas or paper. This artistic conversation could go on for hours. We will see where this new art goes.  Cult Fiction is a fun book, a large sized book with 96 pages. It is humorous at times and sad at other times. I have been enjoying the book because it is divided into each of the artists , so you can pick it up and put it down and it will keep your interest. It has lots of Black and White , but it is appropriate and there are some color work as well. Where does this art fit into our art world today. Time will tell.

Mr. Brady Kane passed away; he had a special relationship with Zarah. When his will is read, his three grandsons are given individual letters with certain expectations and guidelines in order to get their piece of the pie. Rowan is tasked with working at Dreamland for six months during which he must find a way to improve it so that it can progress and do well in the long run. Because of this, he proposes his creative department to come up with a way to fix and improve the theme park.  Zahra has always wanted to do more in life, and when this opportunity to present for the creative department comes up, she goes for it. When Rowan sees and hears her presentation, he’s enthralled, but then when he sees her drawings/graphics, he realizes she needs help. Out of all the creators that presented, her proposal is the best. There’s something about her that draws him to her, whether it’s her feisty personality or her outlook in life, but he wants to help her improve her project; plus, she doesn’t necessarily sensor herself around him 💁🏻‍♀️. So he adopts a different persona in the form of secret text messages in order to get a little bit more into her head (since he and her have had some… um… issues) and ends up *gasp* helping her by going back to a previous passion of his- drawing.  Of course, the chemistry, the connection, is undeniable- they can’t help but pant around each other. I mean, I felt every breath, every heartbeat, every butterfly- AND I LOVED IT.

Or a handsome boss who’s always grumpy, but secretly finds happiness with the littlest things the female lead does? There’s so much to go on about “The Fine Print” By: Lauren Asher and I haven’t even touched the surface.  This was another one of Lauren’s books that I’ve been dying to get my hands on! Before reading this book, I was very excited with the premise of Rowan and Zahra working together on a project to improve the theme park that Rowan owns. Just by reading the first few chapters, I could totally see the whole “grumpy/ sunshine” trope shining through the pages. Rowan was very much reserved and serious around everyone, but when he met Zahra, he wasn’t use to her bubbly personality. Almost to the point that, Rowan questioned Zahra’s motives of being positive all the time. Luckily for Rowan, not everyone has an ulterior motive, Zahra was naturally a sweet, lovable person who was kind to everyone.  I loved seeing Zahra’s personality making little changes in Rowan such as, him smiling at the things she would say over text, or whenever Zahra got excited over an idea for Dreamland, her enthusiasm rubbed off own Rowan and he got excited too. The relationship between Zahra and Rowan was amazing from beginning to end! Rowan was literally the grumpy pants, whereas Zahra was sunshine personified. This was my second time reading the “grumpy sunshine” trope ( 1st one being another one of Lauren Asher’s books 💕). Something about a serious man turning into an absolute sucker, puddle of melted chocolate over the cheery, happy female lead gets me right in the feels ( and heart 🥺♥️). Those types of men make the absolute hopeless romantic in me wish that a man would go above and beyond for me just the way Rowan did for Zahra, a.k.a. Increasing my love for fictional men 💘  One of the many things I loved about Zahra, aside from her cheerful, bubbly personality was her determination to make things better, and stand up for herself. I think sometimes when people meet someone like Zahra, who’s always positive and upbeat, they have the misconception that she won’t fight back, but that’s entirely wrong. In the story, Zahra reclaimed in strength in many ways from applying to becoming a Creator and submitting her ideas for Dreamland, to not allowing others stomp all over here. Zahra may be as sweet as a cupcake 🧁 but she can also stand her ground when she feels like it. In addition, while Zahra was generally happy, she struggled with trusting others specifically men especially since she had a bad experience where a *certain, dumb, ex- male individual betrayed her* Honestly I didn’t blame Zahra for having her reservations when it came to matters of her heart because, she didn’t want to get hurt again. Learning more about what Zahra’s struggles made me appreciate her growth and overall love for it because, it highlighted that even the happiest of people have problems of their own. Zahra was a beautiful character and I absolutely cherished of second reading about her 🥺💘.  For a Rowan to say, “it’s just casual”, is like saying, “look I see pigs flying!”, ok that was an exaggeration with the analogy, but you get my point that everything Rowan did WAS NOT CASUAL! The man freaking organized a book signing event with the author Zahra was obsessed with, took her on a surprise vacation, and watched all 17 different versions of “Pride and Prejudice”. For future reference, if a man isn’t willing to watch my favorite movie, or at least to the level that Rowan went for Zahra…. I DON’T WANT IT!! Lauren Asher over giving me more reasons why the fictional men she was written are superior and leave me all in the feels 💘  Towards the end, I was holding back tears 😭 both from happiness and sadness. Best believe by the time I reached the epilogue and extended epilogue, I was resisting the urge to jump up and down and scream to the rooftops my joy for Rowan and Zahra. Bittersweet that I finished this book, but I’m looking forward to reading about Rowan’s other brothers. Let’s see what’s in store once the other books come out!

It is LONG, and usually long books bore the crap out of me, but this one kept giving me JUST enough, to pull back, and keep me craving what would be next. THIS is how you write a long book.

I couldn\'t put it down because I was so desperate to find out what happened next for Nico and Elena.  Elena Salvatore has been the perfect daughter her whole life until 6months ago when she ran away and it has haunted her ever since. Her parents are disappointed and don\'t trust her and now her sister has to have an arranged marriage earlier than expected because Elena is \"\"tainted\"\". Meeting her future brother-in-law should of been easy, but she knows of Nicolas Russo\'s reputation, they call him \"\"Ace\"\", he has mafia blood running through his veins. He\'s rude, brash and takes no victims. She should of stayed away from him but from their very first conversation things were different. Her attraction to him isn\'t right, he is marrying her sister, but why is it everytime she enters a room it\'s her he is looking at.  Nicolas Russo is a hard hearted man and he likes it that way, if you cross him your dead and that incudes his family. He hates the Salvatore family but bringing them together with marriage will mend fences and is a good business move for both sides. Unfortunately he meets Elena and sparks fly, he soon realises that he is going to be marrying the wrong sister. He shouldn\'t be attracted to this woman, but she gets under his skin like no other and he wants her with a passion he has never felt before. Nico is like a man possessed so lord help any man who thinks he can go near Elena. What he needs to remember is that she is not going to be his wife, he needs to keep away from her but fate has other plans.  If taking up the mafia lifestyle meant I could have Nico then sign me up. This man was outrageous in the baddest type of ways. His protective nature towards Elena from the start was heart melting...and also dangerous for any man around her. He fell hard for her and I hated how insecure he was when it came to her feelings towards him, anyone could see they were meant to be together.

Elena Abelli is the daughter of Salvatore Abelli a big crime boss in the united states nicknamed Sweet Abelli on account of her beauty and biddable nature she knows her future is out of her hands and that she lives by different rules to other young girls. A bid for independence six months prior ended badly and Elena is still living with the stain on her reputation.  Nicolas Russo is the Don of one of the five families in New York contracted into marriage with Elena’s younger sister to cement their alliance Elena is just glad it’s not her on the marriage block yet. From the start, these two definitely rub each other up the wrong way, both have prior assumptions about what they think the other is Nico thinks Elena shallow and superficial her head turned by all the attention she gets whilst Elena feels that Nico is a rude and arrogant man which unsurprisingly he actually is. Nico is surprised that the sweet biddable Elena has claws and finds himself instantly drawn and fascinated with her. His new fiancé Adriana pales in comparison and he also has no great interest in her actually finding her a bit weird.  A series of encounters at family gatherings dial up the tension gradually here until finally things are brought to an explosive head. This is slow burn and nothing physically happens between these two until there in a position to act upon their chemistry. There’s inappropriate talk and Innuendos and obvious interest but it’s basically PG. That is until Nico going above and beyond to secure his newest obsession right where he wants her or actually doesn’t but can’t seem to help himself where she’s concerned. The uncertainty about how they feel towards each other is carried on here right until the final pages. A series of miscommunications standing between this couple because of a lack of transparency.  This is dual POV and very well written I did like Elena more than Nico who I did find somewhat abrasive at times but I was invested in the overall outcome. The slow burn was done well I would maybe have liked a bit more communication on both sides and also apologies I really think Nico should have apologised about the incident with his cook and maid that just isn’t done and was just about him scoring points and hurting Elena acting on emotion and just being spiteful if the shoe was on the other foot, well he wouldn’t have taken it so well I’m sure.  Even though this is described as a forbidden romance it didn’t really feel that way to me as both Nico and Adriana had no emotional feelings towards each other and don’t even like each other that much. This really did take the sting out of it and made it a bit of a non-issue. This was definitely a hit and I will be picking up more of this authors work in the future.\"', 'Positive', NULL),

That\'s all I really liked about it.  There are a few grammatical errors, like missing commas and worlds in the wrong place. For example, the sentence will say her instead of him—only minor things.

The author makes slight references to the story of Persephone and Hades, e.g. pomegranates, Persephone only staying for the winter, the one reference to her being the queen of the underworld and Hades being shunned. But there is no fantasy within this book. THey\'re not gods with godly powers; they\'re humans with godlike names. That\'s it.  This not having the fantasy element took something away from this for me, and it made me question the point of having the whole Greek Gods element in the first place. The author should have just made up her own world because once you take the Greek mythology out of the book, it is just a romance book. That thought was the only thing that got me through the book. I had to think of it as not a retelling because it wasn\'t.

The Ravenhood Duet books were recommended to me by some very good friends, so I really wanted to enjoy them and be able to come back to my friends to discuss them, but I just couldn\'t.  ***WARNING: SPOILERS***  First and foremost, this is mostly a review of the second book because it makes the first book almost entirely irrelevant. What was the first book even for? All we needed from that was maybe the prologue and a line or two about how Cee had had sex with both Sean and Dom and, bless her much-too-young heart, thought she was in love with both of them. Then, boom, on to this story, which makes almost all of the first book not matter at all.  I gave two stars instead of one because, for the most part, the sex scenes were fantastic and very well done. It\'s always nice when an author doesn\'t shy from the good stuff. My main issues with the book are: (1) we get none of the answers about the Ravenhood we assumed we\'d get, and (2) I absolutely despise each and every one of the guys Cee was trying to decide among.  Regarding the first, I can\'t make myself care about a secret society like the main character does when she knows next to nothing about it. Cee was all-in because of her love interests, but I was left just sitting there going, \"\"These guys are idiots who like to drink and party and tell themselves that they\'re doing something great for society.\"\" Because we got almost no other information. And that brings me to the second point.  The series likes to portray Sean, Dom, and Tobias as these deep, mysterious guys with noble motives, but all I could see in each of them was every 20-something guy I knew in college who thought he was the last word in what was right and wrong with the world and that George Orwell was the end-all-be-all of political literature. Not to mention that not one of them actually treated Cee well. (For example, the scene where Sean arrives SIX HOURS LATE for a dinner that he knew Cee was cooking for him, and he manipulated HER into apologizing?! Um, no.) I couldn\'t make myself care which one was going to be The One. It was more like, \"\"I wonder if she\'s going to pick the controlling one, the abusive one, or the controlling-abusive one.\"\" When in reality, I wanted her to run far away and find a guy who actually respects her. Sure, they each had good moments with her, but overall I couldn\'t make those moments redeem all the awful things they said and did to her.  If all you\'re looking for are some delicious sex scenes (maybe a ménage-a-tois or two), then give these books a try. But ONLY if that\'s all you\'re looking for, because the story is almost non-existent and the main guys are such terrible people that you\'ll want Cee to run screaming.\"', 'Positive', NULL),

Book two picked right up where book one left us. Cecelia is struggling to move on, but someone new has entered the picture and he wants her gone. He sees her as nothing but a complication that needs to be removed. No one will derail his vision.  He’s the man pulling the strings. He never expected Cecelia. He doesn’t want her anywhere his men or his mission. She’s as stubborn as ever and she’s not going anywhere until her time is up and her future is secure. And so the battle begins. There is a fine line between love and hate. That line is about to explode.  I could not have predicted anything that happened. Expect the unexpected. Prepare to lose your mind more than once. The angst is REAL! The heartache will tear you apart. The love was torturous at times. Lives will be destroyed. Revenge is sought. The goals to take down the corrupt are at the forefront. The struggle for the truth is at the heart of everything.  This duet was so well-written. It will start in the past and then bring us to the present. The storyline was intense and constantly changing. I was completely, totally and utterly consumed. I read it cover to cover in one sitting. It is complex, but it was chock full of relevant issues about power and corruption, wealth and greed. It draws you in with compelling characters and instense chemistry.

There is also what feels like padding here, too, but though we hear much of all the decorating going on over at the place Mavis and Leonardo will share with Peabody and McNab, we don\'t get to see Mavis.

Personally I could do without Peabody as I find the character to be a very silly and immature young woman. I have always found Eve to be a very interesting character and there are still layers to be revealed.

There\'s little of the Eve and Roarke backstory that makes them such beloved and interesting characters. It\'s as though the author (was it really Nora Roberts? I wonder.) remembered the old Dragnet series and decided to give us \"Just the facts\". I actually had to force myself to continue reading it.

(535, 26, 26, 'Ali Ahmad', '3.00', '\"This story and plotline were better than the last 3-4 books in this series. I agree with all the other reviewers that this might not have been the most exciting plotline but it was definitely the most refreshing one compared to the more recent ones. This book weaves two stories/victims into one and while the crime itself might not be scintillating, I think the focus for this book was really less about writing about an amazing crime being perpetrated and more about the relationships. I think this book provided glimpses of what usually happens after the bad guy gets caught and Dallas grills them and closes the book. It shows what happens when we, as readers, end the book and the imagination begins. I know that, personally, I have always imagined what conversations the characters might have when a book ends and there were moments where I think the author really provided that behind-the-scenes look whether that was between Dallas and Peabody or Dallas and Roarke.  Now, you may be wondering why, if I thought this was a great book to add to the series, that I would rate it 3 stars. Great question. The reason why this is rated 3 stars is not because of the storytelling or plotline but mostly due to the editing or lack thereof. Now -- I know we\'re all human and this book was written and is published during a pandemic but that still doesn\'t excuse the punctuation and syntax errors.  There were two glaring errors...or one error and one awkward phrasing decision to keep. I got the kindle version so also not sure if it was an electronic error. Not sure if any other readers or reviewers noticed it also but while these errors might seem small, it makes reading really confusing at times and also detracts from the story. I\'m also not sure if the publisher will ever read this review but I thought I should just throw it out there.  The error I noticed was in the line breaks and quotation marks in dialogue. It didn\'t happen in all the dialogue writing but definitely in 4-5 spots in the book where during the back and forth banter between characters, all of a sudden there would be a line break and then a sentence with opening and closing quotations but instead of it being what you expect (response from the other character), it would actually be a continuation of what was being said. I was always taught that if there was no interruption in a character speaking to not put additional quotations and I\'m pretty sure that\'s still the reasoning particularly as this isn\'t the only book I\'ve been reading these past few months and every other book uses that logic. It\'s not an awful error but it just means that there would be moments I would have to glance back up again and reread.  The other issue was in the use of commas and descriptors in places that don\'t make sense. For example \"\"she\'s a malignant narcissist, classic, and...\"\" -- this was something a character said. I think in reality, no one would quite phrase it that way. Instead, they might say \"\"she\'s a classic malignant narcissist, and...\"\" While it\'s not grammatically incorrect (I think?), it is very awkward, and rarely in spoken English would it have been said that way. There were a couple of other instances similar to this in the rest of the book.  Overall, I think it\'s a good story to add and flesh out the world of Dallas. I just hope moving forward the publishers and editing team really tighten up on the proofreading.\"', 'negative', NULL),

Here we finally got inside Tobias\'s head and discovered the truths and the reasons for all his decisions, good and bad. There were insights and revelations as key moments from his past were interwoven with the present. We saw his pain, guilt and loneliness, the sacrifices he made to protect those he loved and the devastation of the betrayal by and of his own brothers.  The first 70% or so was full of angst, emotion, secrets, lies and fiercely heated passion as Tobias struggled to win Cecelia back in every way. There were so many secrets and I admit I got very frustrated with Tobias for declaring his undying love but still not trusting Cecelia enough to tell her everything, which was the one thing she insisted on to trust and forgive him completely. She was so strong and resolute in what she needed and she stood up and fought for herself and him with such fury, empathy, passion and love.

She (and her pajamas) is truly badass and if this book is mainly focused on the evolution of the King, it is also very much centred on the evolution of its Queen.  The push and pull dynamics between the two of them is what makes this trilogy so addictive and what leaves you raw, tender and more than a little dazed. The angst is so perceptible that I found myself massaging my chest to ease the ache that I felt page after page, from the beginning of Exodus.  I like how many loose ends it tied. I think it also confirmed my strong belief that the necklace was a gift from BOTH Sean and Dom.  There is only one thing missing from the Ravenhood World: a fourth and final book to uncover that gem that is Tyler.\"', 'Positive', NULL),

In every book/movie/show we always get to see the same scenario- girl falls in love with a guy, guy screws up and breaks girl\'s heart, guy begs for forgiveness and girl forgives him... end of story. Yes, but in reality it takes a lot more than a couple of pretty words and \"\"i\'m sorrys\"\". Sometimes the damage is so great that it takes weeks, months, years to finally be able to forgive the one who caused you pain. So thank you Kate Stewart this was very much needed. The Finish Line starts imediately after the ending of Exodus where Cecilia partially accepts Tobias\' apology and decides to give him one last chance. However, as we are familiar with their long and difficult history, it takes a lot for her to actually start trusting him. The book follows both characters as they struggle to overcome everything that went wrong, let go of the past and accept each other\'s love. It takes months and sometimes you as a reader even stop and think if they will actually move past their history and start living again. It seems impossible but over time Cecilia and Tobias find their way back to one another.  \"\"She is my mirror, my judge, and has revealed herself as my sole purpose. She brought direction back to my deadening soul when I lost my way, and she continues to guide me back, a star too bright to ignore, no matter how far I stray.\"\"  \"\"No matter how we came to be, we were and still are. You stole my heart, and you let me love you with it, and made damn sure I knew where its home was.\"\"  I loved their relationship even more than before.

For three years they pretended to be in a relationship to hide their addictions from their families. They have no friends, so that\'s not an issue. They cover for one another, they enable one another, they are each other\'s everything. But as much as they love each other, they come in second to their addiction. It\'s a path of certain destruction until strangers enter their little world. Strangers who become friends, family who won\'t let them go down without a fight.  I\'m reading this series backward. I started with Maximoff and Farrow, now I am reading the story of the first generation. I like it this way, getting the history after I know the outcome. Lily and Lo are so likable and it\'s odd because they shouldn\'t be. There\'s nothing pretty about addiction. It\'s awful, it\'s pathetic. It makes others view the addict with contempt, revulsion, and pity. But that\'s only part of it. Addicts are real people, not just their drug of choice. They are scared, broken, angry, hurting. This story exposes every side of Lily and Lo. You love them, you pity them, you want better for them. It hurts to be with them.

(553, 44, 26, 'Ali Ahmad', '5.00', '\"This review was originally posted to Goodreads and Booked J. It may not be spoiler free.  “The deeper we sink, the harder it is to crawl out. I fear the moment where neither of us can breathe again–when someone discovers our secrets. At any moment, everything can crumble beneath us. The dangerous game both excites and terrifies me.”  In all honesty, New Adult is not my typical genre. Not because it’s filled with bad selections but because I often feel as though I am reading the same book, the same plot, the same relationships every time. Addicted to You is not one of those books–there’s something far more interesting and authentic to it than the rest of its genre. My first thought on this series is how much it means to me and the second is how annoyed with myself that I didn\'t purchase physical copies.  Krista and Becca Ritchie provide us with so much heart in one tiny story. This isn’t your typical love story and I don’t mean that in the cliche sort of way. For a lot of people, it won’t be the same way but the vast majority agree that there’s just something about this novel that is so captivating.  Addicted to You is a great introduction to a series because we see the flaws and addictions right away in Lily and Lo. Both have been best friends for years. As far as family knows, the two are in a relationship with each other and have been for three years; they live with one another.  They have an arrangement two so they can keep up appearances and seem like good, upstanding people. Lily and Lo are the picture perfect couple on the exterior and behind closed doors, they struggle.  Enabling each other isn’t how they view it, but by pretending to be a couple and embracing their addictions in the way that they do and covering for each other as opposed to helping, they are ultimately leading to their own downfall (as a pair and as individuals): Lo, alcohol. Lily, sex.  Things grow more complicated when their darkest sides reach an all time high–for Lily, it’s waking up in a strange room with two strange men. Something in this event startles her for quite a while and she once again faces the fact that she has a serious problem. Sex addiction isn’t something that can be approached easily, as so many people are gross and don’t want to believe it is a real thing, but Lily has such a hard time focusing on such mundane tasks without fantasies it’s hard to see why people can’t understand it.  Lily Calloway has a serious problem and you can’t help but to hope she gets the help she deserves.  Soon after our story begins, Lily and Lo embrace their feelings for each other without giving up their vices. Along the way, they cruise through their struggles and family life and school and forming friendships with others mid-novel.  They start a relationship–real this time–and things could be better but they could be worse. It’s obvious they love each other, but at the end of the day, like I said, they are enablers to each other and need help.  Back to the all time high for Loren Hale.  For Lo, it’s one fateful night (his 21st birthday) where he steals liquor at a party, nearly gets his ass kicked, and has to be carried up the stairs by a new addition to their lives, Ryke Meadows. He doesn’t let up even after this event but in some ways it really wakes him up to his problem and opens himself up to Ryke, who genuinely cares about him.  It was unexpectedly nice to see the additions of Conner and Ryke to Lily and Lo’s life. They kind of blended in so naturally with the two and the plots and seemed like they were in place all along. Conner and Ryke care a great deal for Lo and it is nice to see them wanting to help the man in spite of how little they seem to know him. And eventually, how much they show an interest in helping Lily as her addictions come to light.  I also enjoyed seeing one of Lily’s sisters, Rose Calloway.  “In the end, it was not a boy who helped me. It was my sister.”  Rose is very… oh, I can’t actually describe her. I loved her first scene, the way she is described as she enters the room. She has a cold exterior, no bullshit attitude, but she has a really solid heart and this much you can see when Lily finally confides in her after a disastrous night out at the club.  Their relationship is beautiful. I mean that. It’s not a very common thing to see a sibling bond like theirs in literature, let alone New Adult. You see, Rose and Lily are sisters in every way. They fight. They get snippy. They don’t always do the right thing. But at the end of the day, they support and love each other in every way that you would want.  I’m interested to see more of Rose and her interactions with Lily. And the other Calloway girls. I’m interested to see more of Rose’s interactions with Lo, now that she understands him better and respects him for seeking help for his addiction.  I’m also very interested in seeing her relationship with Connor explored. There’s something about the two that just seems… well, right. And I can’t wait to explore that more heavily as we get to know the characters. That, and her fashion line and everything really. I just want to know everything about Rose Calloway--who doesn\'t?  Addicted to You is a wonderful read. A true standout in the NA genre that will surely continue to establish itself in the masses. I thought the ending was lovely: Lily and Lo getting help for their addictions, gaining a support system (and in Lo’s case gaining a brother in Ryke) and thought the entire novel was a fresh, important take on the tough topics it tackles.  I\'m excited to see their relationship grow and flurish as they embrace help and try to conquer their demons. It\'s going to be a battle but there\'s something about these two that is redeemable and that they are up for the challenge. Especially since they have something to truly fight for: each other.  The topics aren\'t something you should overlook. Addiction, love, family, seeking help. Strong female leads, strong male leads--all good people, with flaws, worthy of good things. All those things that make life. It is also something that is so raw at times your heart will race or break and you really begin to root for these characters, understand them in a way you didn’t know possible. Krista and Becca are on fire with this standout.  Don’t ignore the hype. I can’t wait to continue binge reading the entire series and already am regretting not buying the physical copies. I can already tell this series is going to be one of my favorites of all time and I hope you enjoy it, too.  But wait! There’s more!  (Yes, I did that television advertisement voice.)

At first I thought I\'d made a mistake. When I realized that the heroine is a sex addict and the hero is an alcoholic, I wanted to smack myself for choosing this one as a blind read. I\'m usually a more light hearted reader and I thought for sure I was going to end up not finishing this book. So here I am after pretty much binge listening (audiobook) to this until I finished and giving it 5 stars.  I gotta give props to this author duo. The writing was fantastic. While I couldn\'t relate to the hero and heroine AT ALL, I was completely drawn into their lives. There were moments that I was so uncomfortable, there were some pretty cringy and humiliating moments, but I was completely sucked in. I just needed to know where this was going. Then Connor and Ryker got added in and I was even more hooked.  I can see there will be more with Lily\'s sisters, Connor and Ryker and I want to read about them all. My fingers were itching to buy the next book. BUT... this time I did start reading the blurbs and it looks like Lily and Lo continue to be the main characters in all 5 books in the series. Can I really handle the addictions in that many books? I may need therapy if I continue. I\'m going to waiver back and forth on if I should buy the next book but let\'s face it, I probably will. My curiosity is going to get the best of me.  BTW, the audiobook was excellent due to a really great narrator. Which really means that not only will I buy the next book, but I will also buy the audible companion book. I won\'t be able to help myself which is fitting since this series is about addiction.

I have to say when this book was first brought to my attention I was like \"\"Addiction, that\'s a tricky one, I\'m going to have to read that.\"\" To then find out it was about a female sex addict was so interesting to me because even girls that have slept with no one can be called sluts, how was someone that actually has a compulsion going to deal with it and be dealt with by other people?  I remember reading Junk when I was 14/15 and I was just so angry at how they got into drugs and how easy it was for the situation to completely flip over but still I knew that I had read a life changing book. I felt the same reading this but without the anger. There\'s no apologizing for the addictions that they both have. There\'s acceptance that they have it and the fear of others finding out. This book is an amazing start to an amazing series.  The Addicted Series is so important socially and morally. Is it okay to be cover up for someone\'s addiction to make them feel better? Is it okay to not even try and curb your addiction? I think people have a very black and white view of addiction and this story helps to focus on people with addictions rather than addictions in people. The characters in this series are phenomenal, they\'re all from the same background (my one and only real criticism of the book) but with such different and distinct personalities that I believe is what really makes the series.

I had never read a ~spicy~ book before but I was interested and I was also interested in the F1 aspect it had. I was nervous that there wouldn’t be enough plot to this book to get me through. I finished this book in less than three days and it only took that long because I was busy. I carried that book everywhere in case I got the opportunity to read. The connection does not feel rushed or dragged on. It also feels very realistic. While there isn’t a major plot line, it had enough to satisfy my need for that. This printed version has some errors; occasionally at the start of a chapter, a word will be missing from one page to the next (but it can be easily guessed and doesn’t throw the book off), and a few typos with spaces but these were few and far between. This statement is mostly for whoever prints it (if you are reading this, hi!!!!). This was a good book to read as my introduction into spice. I am aware that there are other books in this series but these cover other character relationships. Book one focuses on just Maya and Noah and has a wonderful conclusion to the story. I would love to read more about their life but the rest of the books don’t focus on them and that makes me hesitant to read. The character development in this book is very well done. Additionally, this version of the book has a discrete cover that makes it look like any other book. So that’s a plus.  The only reason this book doesn’t receive five stars is 1.) because of the typos and errors in printing, not really an issue but definitely something that makes you stop reading to look at, and 2.) not enough plot for me (this is totally a personal preference). As I said, I was glued to this book the entire time I was reading it but a girl likes to have some more plot you know? The plot is mostly just Maya and Noah, as chapters skip around the timeline to focus on the two of them but it still had enough plot to keep me interested. Overall, I am very well pleased with this book. Also, I believe this author is not super well known, atleast not until TikTok (I could be very wrong and I apologize) but for a book for a newer author, this is very very good.

WITH ANOTHER FICTIONAL MAN 😆 Lauren Asher you did not disappoint, your book has lived up to the hype 🙌🏻💕 I’ve never watched Formula One races, but… after reading this book, I think I might start watching.  This book (and series) has been one I’ve been dying to get my hands on, and finally I’ve gotten the chance to read it! This book made me feel like I was in all the locations for the races, I felt like I was in the pit with Maya as she was vlogging the behind the scenes of the races, attending fancy galas with the Bandini team, and watching the romance bloom between Maya and Noah ☺️❤️  I felt a kinship with Maya in regards to her trying to find her place, especially being a post-grad trying to navigate the new journey she sets out on. Maya was a woman who shared a close relationship with her family, and I loved reading the scenes between her and her brother, Santiago ( protective big brother haha). While Maya was happy for Santiago accomplishing his dream of becoming part of the Bandini team, Maya at times felt like she was in her brother’s shadow, which I found relatable.  Now when it came to Noah… OH MY GOD! First thing that comes to mind is “THOSE BLUE EYES LET YOU KNOW WHERE HOME IS🥺” Ugh I’m officially a sucker for dark brunettes, with piercing blue eyes, and happen to be named Noah Slade 😍. As I kept reading, my love for Noah & Maya grew exponentially! Especially the way Noah became a total sentimental, lovey dovey 🥰, romantic man for Maya.  I would say that “Throttled” is a slow build romance, which I can say was well worth the wait. The chemistry between Maya and Noah was amazing, and let’s just say when they finally decide to fully commit to one another, their scenes were…. FANTASTIC! PASSIONATE! SPICY 🌶😏  Aside from the romance, and falling in love with the characters, I loved the character development with Noah. I feel like character development is something I’m always interested to see because, it shows me how much the character has changed whether it’s due to a negative or positive event, seeing changes unfolds reveals a lot of the character. Noah went from a playboy, who’s sole purpose was winning all the time, to meeting Maya and collective taking the time to think over his life decisions, and most significantly going to therapy to sort out all his personal feelings, etc.  Overall, I couldn’t put this book down!

I completely ignored real life for two straight days and just dove into this immersive, intense, hot, violent, and exhilarating read. I don’t know how she does it, but Malpas has somehow made me love books that contain things that I hate. As with the fabulous The Brit, if you’d told me the storyline ahead of time… I wouldn’t have been interested. And I was nervous about the intensity of the first few steamy scenes in this, particularly some of the boundaries that are pushed. But I was absolutely engrossed in the story, and the mental games swimming beneath the steam had me turning the pages at an alarming rate. This couple is like a blazing inferno – burning hot and passionate; fueled by lust, grief, and a connection that ties them together even when they want nothing to do with each other. The push/pull, cat and mouse game between them was utterly addictive, and my eyes were glued to every scene, taking in every nuance and subtle shift in the relationship.  Do you need to read The Brit before starting this? Yes. Definitely yes. Not just because it’s a great book, but because the characters live in the same world, and the storylines interconnect. The two books have very different vibes – this one is less mafia and more head games with LOTS of steam – but they both have the same kind of intensity and storylines that become action-packed along the way. This also ends on a major CLIFFHANGER that ties the series together, so I recommend that you read in order. I honestly have no idea what we’ll get in the third book, but you’ll definitely be seeing more of these characters.  The story follows Beau, a woman who has lost herself. A former cop, Beau was once a rising star in law enforcement. After the death of her mother, a detective, Beau has lost her trust in the justice system – and lost her desire to live. She’s been struggling through the fog of depression and grief for the last two years, and it doesn’t seem like anything can pull her out of it. Until Beau meets a man. A mysterious, enigma of a man. All of Beau’s instincts are telling her to run from James, but he provides an escape from the depression… and that is all kinds of appealing. Desperate to feel something other than grief, Beau ignores the red flags that pop up all around James, and lets herself be pulled into his orbit. But she has no idea what she’s getting herself into.  One of the best things about this book is that even though I read (and loved) The Brit, I still had zero idea what to expect from this. The one-of-a-kind, layered storyline had me completely hooked, and it took so many unexpected turns along the way. It’s MEGA STEAMY, with boundary-pushing scenes and flawed characters who complement each other perfectly. James and Beau’s broken pieces fit together in a way that is compelling and unique, and the endless tension between them kept me riveted. I felt so invested in their relationship, and James makes for quite the antihero. This complex romance ties in with a brutal and suspenseful storyline, and the combination made this 500-page book fly by. It’s certainly not for the faint of heart, but if you made it through The Brit unscathed, then The Enigma will leave a lasting impression. It’s not a book that I’ll be forgetting anytime soon, and book three cannot be here soon enough.

If you loved The Brit, The Enigma is going to blow you away. It’s graphic. It’s gritty. It’s a whole lot of steamy too!! It’s an unconventional love story. But most of all it’s so good.

Maybe it was just a natural occurrence that she would follow in her mom’s footsteps becoming an FBI agent. That is until Beau witnessed the demise of her mom in a blazing detonation of her car. The explosion also left Beau injured and permanently scarred from the flaming inferno created by it. This turned Beau’s world topsy turvy. She left her fiancé at the alter and embarked on her mission of seeking justice for her mom’s death after it was determined to have been an accident. As a result of what happened to her mom Beau has been left with a life filled with tumultuous demons. She had spent the last few years of her life away from crowds, filled with anxiety and living with her two uncles so she wasn’t alone.  James Kelly is a cold-blooded killer. Seeking revenge of the death of his whole family from a fire at the hands of a mafia king who went by the name of The Bear. James was dealing with his own kind of justice at the barrel end of a gun. He was systematically taking out The Bear’s men one by one, waiting for the day he would be able to take out The Bear himself. James was an enigma, there was little folks knew about him but he was strong, he was smart and he was determined. The thing is James has his own demons to battle and interesting enough he also has been burned by a fire.  After one of the most bizarre of circumstances the two meet. Which ultimately leads to James hiring Beau to paint his office. And then the tug of war between James and Beau begins a delicate dance. Let’s just say there is a tremendous amount of sexual tension that will eventually lead to some pretty steamy sex. Yet, Beau soon figures out that being with and around James seems to bring her calm and peace… even when not knowing much about him with her instinct telling her to leave him alone. I loved that even with their messed-up lives that they found a sanctuary in each other. That love could bloom, and they might be able to work together.  The whole dichotomy of The Enigma is that in a way both Beau and James were after the same thing, but they had difference methods about how to arrive at the same place. Beau and her law enforcement background was fighting for justice to prevail and prove her right. At the same time, James was like a vigilante, taking it upon himself to seek revenge for his family’s deaths. Both essentially getting the same end results. One legally, the other not!  Be ready to hang on to your seat as the book becomes a bit of a wild ride (cue: grab a notepad) as you get toward the end of the book. AND if you are loving The Enigma, you’ll have a great big smile on your face since there is another book coming!!  Favorite Quotes: “I don’t want to fix you. I want to love you.”  “I’ve fought for power Beau,” I whisper. “I’ve fought for freedom. For revenge. For hatred. But I’ve never fought for love.” And it’s the toughest f#@%&*$ battle yet. “Can I win?” I ask, and she slowly lowers her arse to her heels, silent. Stunned. “Answer me,” I grate. ‘Because everything is f#@%&*$ irrelevant otherwise.” I join her, settling my arse on my heels too. “So, Can I win?” “Can I?” she counters quietly.  “She’s toxic. But to me, she’s a balm. And I’m fatal. But to her, I’m life.”\"', 'Positive', NULL),
(575, 66, 26, 'Ali Ahmad', '5.00', '\"Wow… just wow!! Jodi Ellen Malpas has once again outdone herself with this incredible follow up to The Brit.  If you loved Danny Black and his enticing darkness, then you will definitely fall head over heels for The Enigma that is James Kelly.  His darkness stems from the pain of losing his entire family to the underworld of gangsters vying for position and territory in a dangerous world that once you’re in, you’ll either live under the constant threat of being exposed or die in the effort to keep yourself and those you love hidden.  For The Enigma, his vengeance has led him into a murderous lifestyle… exacting his revenge on the evil that took out his family. He’s an assassin… a silent vigilante. He won’t stop until he’s found the person who gave the order. But that brings him into the life of a woman who will change his every purpose and turn his world upside down.  Beau Hayley… daughter of his FBI nemesis is broken. Her world exploded and her future imploded leaving her lost and damaged. Darkness is all she can see until she can lay to rest her demons and discover the truth around her mothers shocking death. She needs answers. Why is it being covered up? Who is to blame? Refusing to accept it as an accident. But her digging could open up a dangerous plot that could find her with the same fate as her mother. It could expose the identity of the elusive killing machine that is The Enigma.  James and Beau are drawn together by a common goal… but a need to stop her exposing him causes conflict when instead of killing her to protect his identity, he ends up feeling a more desperate need to protect her.  If you looking for a lovey-dovey romance… this is not it. If your wanting passion fuelled desire, lust driven erotic encounters with masochistic tendencies then this is the perfect coupling.  There’s more fighting and fierce words, than cuddles and kindness but for some reason it seems so right. So perfect. They are the light to each other’s darkness. They are intimate without the sweet sappiness. When there are moments of tenderness they are so beautiful in contrast to the harshness that usually exists between them that it’s endearing and has more impact on the old emotions.  I have laughed, I have cried and my heart has raced in fear and worry throughout this amazing rollercoaster ride. And when a certain character comes back into the frame towards the end, you know that the next part of the story is going to absolutely blow you away.  Did I guess who was behind the deception? Yes, but I’d had my doubts if I’d be right and changed my mind between two suspects. It’s a clever plot that keeps you guessing and on the edge of your seat.  I truly hope James and Beau get their rainbow ending (in more ways than one!). After all their hurt they deserve their wounds to be healed and mended together.  Excellent story… a real page turner that I couldn’t put down and I now can’t wait for the next part.. The Resurrection. Thank you JEM for another incredible alpha and truly bada$$ female heroine.\"', 'negative', NULL),

Now two years on since her emotional trauma now an ex cop Beau’s dogged insistence that they should re investigate what happened with her beloved mother is still a priority for her but given that she’s already on James’ radar, now it’s only a matter of time before the two meet ….. There is so much going on in this complex story there are twists turns , plenty of emotional roller coaster rides , sickening betrayal , and plenty of OMG moments . The sexual tension oozes out of the pages as James introduces Beau to his BDSM world and with such raw emotional backgrounds on both sides you could say that they a perfect couple.

I never know where the story will lead, but I’m always eager to hang on for the ride. This series has been blazing hot and immensely compelling, so this had a lot to live up to - and it exceeded all expectations. It might\'ve even surpassed the other two books in the series. Going in, we knew absolutely nothing about either main character, and that made this an epically unpredictable adventure. I had zero idea what I was getting into, and that meant it was a fun, immersive read. This one plays up the dark humor, the banter, and the seriously smokin\' chemistry. I laughed out loud as often as I fanned myself over the steam. I LOVED this couple together, and the first half just flew by for me. Things get heavier and tenser as the story progresses, and the intimacy escalates along the way. It\'s the perfect addition to a stellar series, approaching the mafia trope from a different direction. I loved every minute of it.  The story follows Riley, a woman whose life is turned upside down when she discovers that her estranged sister is dating a mafia boss. While the sisters haven\'t been close for years, Riley agrees to take a trip and meet Sloane\'s new guy. She had no idea what she was getting into. It\'s not long before Riley realizes that she\'s in way over her head, and there\'s a Giant Hot Dangerous Stranger following her every move. The man is fierce and intimidating, obviously up to no good, and yet... strangely appealing. There\'s just something about him that calls to Riley, and he seems equally confounded by her. As the two continue their strange interactions, things take an unexpected turn.  Now, I\'m not gonna spoil the book for you. I think most of us expected Diego to be the next antihero, but let me say that I was NOT disappointed by Malek. He is soooo not what I was expecting, and I loved seeing the different sides of him. While this feels very much a part of the same series, this particular story has a completely different feel than the others. It\'s JT at her best, with some softer, subtler moments and an antihero who is obviously bad, but... not. These two are fantastic together, and I loved going in blind. I want to tell you all the things that I loved about Malek, but I also don\'t want to give the story away, so I\'ll tell you that he is a fascinating man and leave it at that. This book also makes the series as a whole richer and stronger; sure, it can technically be read as a standalone, but you don\'t want to do that. It also opens up some interesting paths for future books in this world, and I. AM. READY. Buckle up, because this is a sexual tension-filled, unpredictable read.\"', 'Positive', NULL),

I could have never knew that anyone could match Sloane badass-ery, but enter stage left Riley. This books banter is mind blowing and down right hilarious. I caught my self audibly laughing at some of the conversations. I was entertained cover to cover.  Daddy Declan and Sloane makes big appearances. Along with Kage, Nat, Spider, and Kieran (my favorite Irish bodyguard.) So the gangs all here.  New favorite character- Poe the crow. Very clever naming.

Be still my heart, because book 3 in the Queens and Monsters series definitely stole my heart. I didn’t think it was at all possible for this author to give us a more hilarious heroine than Sloane, but I shouldn’t have doubted because Sloane has been replaced by Riley in my opinion! This story was filled with lots of hilarity, alpha male hotness overload, vengeance, danger, tenderness, steaminess, and romance. I loved the appearances of several characters from the other books in the series as well as other series (which included one character surprise I didn’t anticipate) and the hilarious interactions of the alpha hot males who dislike each other, as well as the witty banter between the Monsters and their Queens. Malek may be my new favorite hot, brooding alpha, but there are so many to choose from in J.T. Geissinger’s books, that I really can’t be sure. If it wasn’t for the fact my job got in the way, I would have devoured this book in under 24 hours, and I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s the same for everyone else who reads it.

I liked reading the scenes between Liam and Sophie from early on in the relationship, specifically Sophie trying to resist Liam, and Liam describing in detail how much he wanted Sophie for himself ( shout out to those Liam Chapters which were juicy 🥵to read lol). “Collided” gave us the scenes that we didn’t know we needed. While reading, I recognized certain scenes that were mentioned in the first book, and luckily it revealed what really happened between Liam and Sophie, during the midst of Maya and Noah’s romance from the first book. I would say Liam definitely falls under the category of “guy falling for girl first” trope because, while Sophie was attracted to Liam, she had her reservations/ doubts about pursing something with him.  I loved seeing Sophie embracing her adventurous side because, she had a lot of energy and her creating *that list* 😏 gave her an excuse to do things she’s wanted to try, and experience life. Not to mention, adding Liam into the mix was lots of fun to read.  For all the fun and romance that happened in “Collided”, it did bring up some deep topics, without giving any spoilers, Liam’s journey from keeping himself closed off due to a tragic event that occurred a few years prior, affected his way of living life, but with Sophie, Liam was able to gain a clear sense that it’s alright to fall in love, and allow yourself happiness.

But sadly life got in the way, and it took me a little while to start this book. But once I did, I couldn’t put it down! I was so excited to get back to Lily and Loren’s relationship and see how they would navigate their new life, and this book definitely delivered that and so much more I never expected.  I loved seeing Lily and Lo’s story continue, it was heartbreaking and adorable all at the same time. Seeing Lo turn around from the guy he was in the first book and now be a reliable rock for Lily to lean on was really heartwarming to see. And I really liked that their healing wasn’t linear. They both had plenty of bad days and good days, so their journey of healing from their addictions felt super real. One aspect of this story that really surprised me was the sisterly relationships between the Calloway sisters. I knew that eventually in the later books the 3 of them became very close, but I wasn’t expecting that relationship to start building now, but I’m so glad it did. The Mexico chapters were definitely my favorite part of the book, and seeing the sisters all so happy to be together was absolutely adorable.  I think overall this book was fantastically done, but there were some aspects that I couldn’t really look past. First, this book was long. Like really really long. I enjoyed all of the extra moments we got between the characters, but some of it didn’t feel super vital to the story. Meanwhile there were moments in this book that felt super important and monumental to these characters, that were a bit rushed and brushed off. I would’ve enjoyed seeing more of the aftermath of Lily’s terrible therapist, the betrayal Ryke went through, and the adorable moment between Lily and Loren in the last chapter. These moments feel a lot more important than the things that happened at the beginning of the book that got way more page time. I only hope that these moments will be touched on more in future books.  Despite the rocky pacing of this book, I still really enjoyed it.

After all, this series started with Maya and Noah, so it only seems fitting that it would end with Santiago and Chloe.  Reading this book, I came to the realization that this was my first time reading 📖 a “fake relationship” trope, and I enjoyed it! Right from the beginning, the craziness ensued with Chloe somehow breaking into Santiago’s home and then pretending to be boyfriend and girlfriend for the sake of Santiago’s family, and others. If someone were to ask me how I would describe Santiago and Chloe I would say, unique, crazy ( but in a good way), fun, never a dull moment with these two, and a fierce love that I envied.  Once again, Lauren did an amazing job bringing attention to serious topics like, Santiago dealing with his injury, mental health, and more. Similar to the previous book, “Wrecked”, Lauren did the book justice by providing realistic insights into how Santiago was still coming to terms with his injury, especially years after losing a significant part of his life that greatly impacted his career. With the introduction of Chloe, she was the ray of sunshine that helped Santiago come out of his “doom and gloom” attitude, and helped him on the path to regaining a sense of the person he use to be before his accident. Santiago also helped Chloe in a way that she’s never experienced such as, having someone care for her as opposed to always feeling alone & rejected. Together Santiago and Chloe helped one another grow and realize that even though they had different lives before meeting one another, they ended up sharing similar feelings and thoughts which enabled them to find some footing to understand each other.
